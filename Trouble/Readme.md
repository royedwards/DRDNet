# About

This is a small GUI utility designed to help users report problems.  Users reporting problems are rarely useful because they generally don't give enough information about what went wrong, what they were doing when something went wrong, and what was occurring on the system at the time of the failure.

This tool collects an explanation of what just went wrong and automatically files a trouble ticket.  It collects a screenshot, and lots of diagnostic information about the current system state.  This will greatly increase the administrators ability and speed of diagnising and fixing problems.  It's extremely hard to diagnose or fix a problem without a good view of what the system and user were doing at the time of the problem.

This tool collects.

* The description of the user's issue
* A screen capture of whats running on the current system
* The current running jobs and which jobs are using the most resources
* The current system load and RAM utilization
* All processes currently loaded
* The Current network state and utilization
* Currently connected network shares
* Any recent error events
